# ObjectSQLite
Let's use c++ object programming over C implemented SQLite library


This project is just for fun!  
It does not aim at bein productized. Its sole purpose is to use C++20 new 
features, such as modules, concepts, requirements and maybe ranges and 
views in a specific domain: relational databases and SQL.  

It will eventually be used for managing structured data in files within 
other personal projects.

Should you get interested in this development, please fork this repository 
and modify it at your whish by your side. For sure it will be useful for 
your learning of C++20 goodies as well as for your own coding when time 
comes to manage structured data on files as well as in memory, in a 
simplified SQL way.
